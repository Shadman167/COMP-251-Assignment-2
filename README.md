# COMP-251-Assignment-2

A2-Q1 -> This is complete search exercise that I did as part of my assignment for COMP 251.

In this program, I designed an algorithm to completely search the entire space to check every
possible solutions. I choose the most optimal solution as my answer. I decided to solve the exercise
through recursion and branch statements to every solutions.

A2-Q2 -> This is a dynamic programming exercise

I modeled an algorithm where I find the most optimal solution of the closest weights that totaled
1000 kg from a list of multiple weights. This includes finding all the possible solutions to look
that goes closest to 1000kg.

A2-Q3 -> This is a greedy algorithm problem(File name given as HWSched.java)

Here, I attempted to choose a homework plan that took the least time to complete all the way
to the highest. This include maanipulating the weights of the assignments regardless of order of
completion.

A2-Q4 -> A divide and conquer algorithm

Using fibonacci sequences involving letters, I implemented the algorithm that returns the 
K-th letter in the N-th sequence. I devised a way to understand at what sequence K-th letter was
in N-th sequence without generating all possible fibonacci combinations until the N-th sequence.
The algorithm utilises the most optimal time to run the program as I was tested on the time 
complexity of my program as well.
